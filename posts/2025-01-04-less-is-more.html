      <h1>Less is more</h1>
      <span class="metadata">04 Jan 2025</span>
      <p>After 7+ years building products across different markets, I've learned that the best software does one thing exceptionally well. Not ten things poorly.</p>
      <p>Every feature you don't build is a feature that can't break. Every button you don't add is one less decision for your user. Every configuration option you skip is complexity avoided.</p>
      <p>The hardest part isn't building features—it's saying no to them. But that's where the magic happens.</p>
