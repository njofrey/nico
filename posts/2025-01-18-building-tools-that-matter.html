      <h1>Building tools that matter</h1>
      <span class="metadata">16 Jul 2025</span>
      <p>I don't do market research. I build tools to fix my own frustrations with slow, bloated software.</p>
      <p>My UF Calculator was born from the hassle of navigating cluttered financial portals just to get a single number. The VAT calculator is for one purpose: to be faster than a spreadsheet for a repetitive task. I solve problems I know.</p>
      <p>The best tools are invisible. They do their job so well you forget they're there, but you know exactly where to find them when you need them.</p>
